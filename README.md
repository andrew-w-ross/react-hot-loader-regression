# Regression example

This repo is using the setup set in [examples/webpack-modern](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/examples/webpack-modern) so it should be correct.

Run install `npm i` and then start `npm run start`.
Open the page and change `src/Counter.js` text in the h2.

All styling will be lost.

Install `react-hot-loader@4.8.8` and relaunch the start task.
Go back to `src/Counter.js` and the stling will remain on update.
